## Description

Employee Directory is a simple way to organize employee information. 30 randomly generated employees appear in the table, along with randomly generated information such as phone number, email, ID, and even a photo. You have the option of searching via name in the search bar or sorting their names in ascending or descending order alphebetically. The random employees come from the Random User API.
